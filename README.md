A modern, responsive e-commerce storefront built with **React** and **Material-UI**. This project demonstrates core frontend development concepts, including state management, API integration, and component-based architecture.

## ✨ Features
* **Product Catalog:** Dynamically fetched products with high-quality display and filtering.
* **Wishlist System:** Users can save their favorite items to a personal wishlist for future purchase.
* **Shopping Cart Logic:** Full cart functionality, including adding/removing items and real-time calculation.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop using Material-UI's grid system.
* **UI/UX Focus:** Clean, professional interface with consistent styling, interactive elements, and hover effects.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React.js
* **UI Framework:** [Material-UI (MUI)](https://mui.com/)
* **State Management:** React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
* **Data Fetching:** Fetch API / Axios
* **Styling:** CSS3 & MUI System

## 🌸 Note on Imagery
While this is a **Generic Store** architecture designed to fit any retail niche, I chose to use **flower imagery** during development. It added a touch of beauty and joy to the coding process! However, the logic is completely modular and can be easily adapted to any product category.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/marvaBi/GenericStore.git`
2. **Install dependencies:** `npm install`

4. **Run the application:** `npm start`

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## 🧠 What I Learned
* **UI/UX with MUI:** Implementing a robust and accessible UI using **Material-UI** components and themes.
* **State Management:** Managing multiple application states (Cart, Wishlist, Product Data) in React.
* **API Integration:** Fetching and handling asynchronous data from external APIs.
* **Clean Code:** Structuring a scalable React project with reusable and modular components.
